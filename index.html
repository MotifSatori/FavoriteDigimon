      <p class="beezlemonText"> <strong> Beezlemon </strong> is an Evil Digimon. It is one of the "Seven Great Demon Lords", representing Venus and the sin of Gluttony. While it possesses the power to preside over the many Devil Digimon, it dares to observe a solitary existence. It is said that it could stand at the peak of the dark army, "Nightmare Soldiers", if it cared to, although it is also said that there exists a Demon Lord Digimon which surpasses even Beelzemon. It rides on the gigantic motorcycle-type machine, "Behemoth", holding its cherished shotguns, the "Berenjena". Although its personality is cruel and merciless, it is also exceedingly prideful, so it would never attack the weak.</p>

      <p> <strong> Omnimon: Merciful Mode</strong> is a Holy Knight Digimon. It is an Omnimon with white wings, resembling an angel. Having realized that there are some people who can only be saved by fighting, and defeating them, Omnimon transformed into this form through sorrow and determination, and "Photon Spreads", lines of bluish-white light that resemble tears rolling down one's cheeks, have emerged across its whole body. The "Photon Spreads" run across its whole body, temporarily increasing its power drastically. It is a being who relieves Digimon that have become corrupt and are unable to revert back by imposing judgment upon them, and it is said that the targets it attacks are those who always had a "good heart" to begin with. Omnimon's Grey Sword has also been transformed into the katana-like Fearsome Blade.</p>
